# Leo Grigoryan

I am a 15-year-old frontend developer currently studying at LPFA in Yerevan, Armenia. I have graduated from Elbakyan Krthamalir twice and have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React-Redux, THREE.js, Swiper.js, Framer Motion, and other JavaScript libraries. I plan to pursue higher education abroad and learn backend development to become a full-stack web developer.

- **CoffeeHouse Armenian Company's Website Copy**: Built with React.js and all my knowledge, using all the libraries I know. It took around 10 days.
- **Apple Vision Pro Website Copy**: Built without frameworks and libraries, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This was my first big project and took 48 days to complete its one page.
- **iPhone 14 Pro Max Website Copy**: Built without frameworks and libraries, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, similar to the Apple Vision Pro project. It took around 36 days.
- **iPhone 13 Design Copy in 3D**: Built with React.js using the THREE.js library. I positioned every single detail, and it took only 3 days (I later switched to using GLTF objects to make everything faster, prettier, and better).
