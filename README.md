# Leo Grigoryan
**Frontend WEB Developer**

## About me
I am a 15-year-old frontend developer currently studying at LPFA in Yerevan, Armenia. I have graduated from Elbakyan Krthamalir twice and have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React-Redux, THREE.js, Swiper.js, Framer Motion, and other JavaScript libraries. By getting an education there, I gained valuable experience and met many smart people who helped me improve my skills and provided many opportunities for work, study, and further development.

I plan to pursue higher education abroad, which means I'm going to attend university and learn backend development this year to become a full-stack web developer.

## Projects
#### **CoffeeHouse Armenian Company's Website Copy** | Built with React.js and all my knowledge, using all the libraries I know. It took around 10 days.
#### **Apple Vision Pro Website Copy** | Built without frameworks and libraries, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This was my first big project and took 48 days to complete its one page.
#### **iPhone 14 Pro Max Website Copy** | Built without frameworks and libraries, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, similar to the Apple Vision Pro project. It took around 36 days.
#### **iPhone 13 Design Copy in 3D** | Built with React.js using the THREE.js library. I positioned every single detail, and it took only 3 days (I later switched to using GLTF objects to make everything faster, prettier, and better).
#### **The Goonies Website Copy** | Built without frameworks and libraries, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, similar to the iPhone 14 Pro Max project. It took around 18 days.

Here are a few of my projects. You can find more on my GitHub portfolio or my Instagram page, which will start posting from September 2024.

## Closing Statement
This is not the end of my journey. I am becoming better every single day, continuously learning and improving my skills. I am going to become a full-stack developer very soon.
